<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
This app is used to connect you to people physcially that are in clost vicinity to you. This means that it allows you to see people who are close to you and would like to chat in person. Then you can connect with them and go up to them and speak in person. We believe the idea is unique as it has become harder to connect to people offline, and therefore this is made for people who want to do that.

The app has a signup and profile page which allows users to creat an account. Then there is a list of people whom you can see near who are availble to speak near you. You can browse their profiles and select ones you like/have similar interests with, and go up and speak to them.
